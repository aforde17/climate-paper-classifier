Briefly describe the purpose of each file and the number of lines of code
in it.

`bert` - folder that contains all code for the BERT model
  - `bert_implementation.ipynb` 672 lines of code.
  - `bert_implementation_V2.ipynb` 2189 lines of code.
  - `bert_implementation_V3.ipynb` 713 lines of code.
  - `bert_implementation_V4.ipynb` 887 lines of code.
