Briefly describe the purpose of each file and the number of lines of code
in it.

`bert` - folder that contains all code for the BERT model
  - `bert_implementation.ipynb`
  - `bert_implementation_V2.ipynb`
  - `bert_implementation_V3.ipynb`
  - `bert_implementation_V4.ipynb`

`cnn` - folder that contains code for the CNN model.
  - `processing.py` contains processing class
  - `cnn_train_evaluate.ipynb` contains all code for training, defining the model, evaluating accuracy and loss, and graphing results. This file contains some code for CNN implmentation that is sourced inline but can also be found [here](source: https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence/pytorch-conv1d-for-text-classification)

`k_means.ipynb` - implements K-means clustering. 547 lines of code.
`knn.ipynb` - implements K-nearest neighbor code. 650 lines of code.
`logistic.ipynb` - implements Logistic Regression model suing BoW. 793 lines of code.
`logistic_regression_v2.ipynb` - implements Logistic Regression using CBoW. 611 lines of code.
`lstm_model.ipynb` - implements LSTM model. 

– List files that contain code not written by a team member, or not
written as part of this project (maybe it was counted as a part of
another project).
– Contain any other relevant information about your code.
